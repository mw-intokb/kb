so here in this file i ll share with everything 
what did i knew what questions do i have 
maybe then i ll change it ll see bit not yet

first of all i want to infect what is cs 
i think its about our security and protection of it in internet 
maybe its much more deeper, so i want to start my way with basically questions 
what is this, what is that about and what kind of working groups are there
cause now i hvnt ps i ll start only with my phone 
hopefully it'll be fine 

so i ll start my conversation with ai ll see what ll i find out
now im done for me is important and i ll work on it to know everything exactly like it is
i mean deep and hard, my point today was to understand what is computer how does it work
i have didn't understood what is logick i  comp transistors 
how doest it comes in why 0 and 1 is basically computer league 
why it is 1 and 2 why not more or less or another numbers
ll figure out it tomorrow


alright 
i ve got a conversation with ai also watched some videos and what do i can say
i can say that cs is not just about our security in internet its much more deeper
so today i have understood that its about computer, internet, web 
and i have started with learning things about computers
first question that i ve got what is that how does that work

what did i found out:
computer isn't just an machine, there are many things that happening at the same moment inside
i ve asked myself, but how does that work, how computer can understand me and actually work
so it s starting with physics, idk what is happening there so really good but can describe it as diffusion with electric 
this electric go into many half transistors
what is transistor? so it's an technology that  describe os there any electric or not
out of this point comes 1-0 langue
