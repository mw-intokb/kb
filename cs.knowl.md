so here in this file i ll share with everything 
what did i knew what questions do i have 
maybe then i ll change it ll see bit not yet

first of all i want to infect what is cs 
i think its about our security and protection of it in internet 
maybe its much more deeper, so i want to start my way with basically questions 
what is this, what is that about and what kind of working groups are there
cause now i hvnt ps i ll start only with my phone 
hopefully it'll be fine 

so i ll start my conversation with ai ll see what ll i find out
now im done for me is important and i ll work on it to know everything exactly like it is
i mean deep and hard, my point today was to understand what is computer how does it work
i have didn't understood what is logick i  comp transistors 
how doest it comes in why 0 and 1 is basically computer league 
why it is 1 and 2 why not more or less or another numbers
ll figure out it tomorrow


alright 
i ve got a conversation with ai also watched some videos and what do i can say
i can say that cs is not just about our security in internet its much more deeper
so today i have understood that its about computer, internet, web 
and i have started with learning things about computers
first question that i ve got what is that how does that work

what did i found out:
computer isn't just an machine, there are many things that happening at the same moment inside
i ve asked myself, but how does that work, how computer can understand me and actually work
so it s starting with physics, idk what is happening there so really good but can describe it as diffusion with electric 
this electric go into many half transistors
what is transistor? so it's an technology that  describe os there any electricity or not
out of this point comes 1-0 computer language
so there is a rule if there is electricity then it's = 1 if not then = 0
it is basically the way how this 1-0 language was released 
but question how can computer working only with this one half transistor
answer is there much more than one, so at the beginning there are only 2 or 5 half transistors 
they build one transistor, but how and why they can't do it solo
now comes logick, not like humans logick i could describe it as rules in transistors 
so because our computers have pretty much work they need more than 1-2 numbers 
and everyone function has a number, so it s mean that logick has to build of this
1 or 0 and any transistors an number that has function 
in logick we have  basically 3 opportunities/commands and they are ORDER OR AND
with this commands and our number that come out of transistors we can get our function 

now i think about this 1-0 language, do i need it or not cause i guess it is pretty interesting 
but if it is will be useless, idk ll see.
 at the point im very happy, because before i have heard much about this 1-0 language but have didn't got where is that form and why its so

 *important*
 1-0 language is bullshit 1 and 0 was made only for our understanding 
 so it is not the computer language 
today I have learned how does  work memory i  our computers 
so first of all you need to understand what is exactly transistors and logick 
also come new information about the lines, schemes and what is that 
lines are basically the physical way to import our electricity to the memory 
and scheme are ways to interpret our transistor
but why and for what do we need it
answer is : in memory we have many cells that have theirs numbers and function in there
to go to this cell we need bit, bit is nothing more than our numbers
now to the thing why do we need to interpret this numbers 
because cells have 2 meanings of bit first one is call number  and second one is function number 
and so build memory themselve 

at the point i do have some questions like where are this numbers/functions form
i mean how did they build, what are rules, but rest was probably clear without any questions 
tomorrow i want to go a bit deeper in memory, be i guess it s not everything what i can learn from there

today i go straight to the point it is so as o has expected it there was few things more i wanted make any brain work so 
it s the reason why my writing today ll be my best ever 

There are many cells, and they all exist all the time.
Memory is not a single active cell,
but the entire system of cells together with the wires and logic
that allow one specific cell to be selected and used.
The selection logic is not something separate from the transistors themselves —
it’s the same transistors, just used to control access
rather than to perform calculations.
so before i ve didn't understood, how memory is interpret and this thing with lines was clear but i have didn't got tajt solo

alright ll write in 2 days, ll get more information topics cause i guess, needed to know first computer working abd only after that everything what happens there insi
